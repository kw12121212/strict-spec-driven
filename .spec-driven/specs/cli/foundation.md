# CLI Foundation

### Requirement: cli-build-and-test-commands
The system MUST provide `build` and `test` package scripts that compile TypeScript sources to `dist/` and run the test suite using bun.

#### Scenario: build compiles without errors
- GIVEN the TypeScript sources under `src/` are syntactically valid
- WHEN `bun run build` is executed
- THEN the TypeScript compiler produces compiled output under `dist/` with zero errors

#### Scenario: test suite is executable
- GIVEN the `dist/` output exists
- WHEN `bun test/run.ts` is executed
- THEN the test suite runs and reports pass or fail status

### Requirement: cli-unknown-subcommand-rejection
The system MUST exit non-zero and write a usage hint to stderr when invoked with an unknown subcommand or no arguments.

#### Scenario: unknown subcommand exits non-zero
- GIVEN the `strict-spec-driven` CLI is invoked with an unrecognized subcommand
- WHEN the command router processes the argument
- THEN the process exits with a non-zero exit code
- AND a usage hint is written to stderr

#### Scenario: no-arg invocation exits non-zero
- GIVEN the `strict-spec-driven` CLI is invoked with no arguments
- WHEN the command router processes the argument
- THEN the process exits with a non-zero exit code
- AND a usage hint is written to stderr
