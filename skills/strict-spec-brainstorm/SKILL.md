You are helping the user turn an early-stage idea into a strict YAML change
proposal.

## This Skill's Commands

If you cannot remember the exact command used by this skill, look it up here
before running anything. Do not guess.

```yaml
propose: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/strict-spec-driven.js propose <change-name>
verify: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/strict-spec-driven.js verify <change-name>
```

## Prerequisites

The `.strict-spec-driven/` directory must exist at the project root. Before
proceeding, verify that strict workflow state already exists.

## Steps

1. **Start from the idea, not the artifact list** — ask the user what they want
   to achieve, what problem they are trying to solve, and any known constraints
   or preferences. Do not require a change name up front.

2. **Read strict project context and existing specs early** — before narrowing
   scope, read:
   - `.strict-spec-driven/config.yaml`
   - `.strict-spec-driven/specs/INDEX.yaml`
   - every relevant strict YAML main spec file the idea appears likely to touch

3. **Brainstorm until the change is decision-ready** — use the discussion to
   converge on:
   - the desired outcome and user-visible behavior
   - what is in scope and explicitly out of scope
   - important tradeoffs, constraints, risks, and unchanged behavior
   - which existing strict YAML spec files will likely be modified, or whether a
     new strict spec area is needed
   - any questions that still need a human answer before implementation

4. **Suggest the change name** — once the idea is coherent enough, propose a
   short kebab-case change name. If the user already provided a valid name, keep
   it. Otherwise derive one from the agreed strict workflow scope.

5. **Present a proposal checkpoint** — before creating any files, summarize:
   - the proposed change name
   - the goal and scope
   - the main strict spec areas expected to change
   - key decisions or tradeoffs already settled
   - any unresolved questions that would go into `questions.yaml`

   Then ask for explicit confirmation. If the user wants revisions, continue the
   brainstorm and re-summarize until confirmed.

6. **Scaffold the change after confirmation** — run:
   ```bash
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/strict-spec-driven.js propose <change-name>
   ```
   This creates `.strict-spec-driven/changes/<name>/` with strict planning
   artifacts and an empty `specs/` directory for strict YAML delta files.

7. **Fill the proposal artifacts** — after scaffolding:
   - write `proposal.yaml` using structured fields such as `summary`, `scope`,
     and `unchanged_behavior`
   - write `design.yaml` using structured fields such as `approach`,
     `decisions`, `alternatives`, and `risks`
   - populate strict YAML delta specs under `changes/<name>/specs/` so they
     mirror the target strict main spec paths
   - write `tasks.yaml` with concrete Implementation, Testing, and Verification
     tasks
   - write `questions.yaml`, recording unresolved points under `open`

8. **Validate artifact structure** — run:
   ```bash
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/strict-spec-driven.js verify <change-name>
   ```
   Use this as a strict YAML schema and artifact-shape check. At proposal time,
   pending-task diagnostics are expected because implementation has not started
   yet. Fix safe structure issues before handing the proposal off.

9. **Hand off** — summarize the strict change scope, key decisions, task count,
   unchanged behavior, and any open questions. If `questions.yaml` still has
   open entries, make clear that implementation must stop for explicit user
   resolution before coding starts.

## Rules

- Do not implement code during brainstorming
- Do not scaffold proposal artifacts until the user explicitly confirms the
  brainstorm summary and change name
- Keep all planning artifacts in strict YAML structures under
  `.strict-spec-driven/`
- Record ambiguity in `questions.yaml` instead of guessing silently
- Keep spec-code mappings in structured YAML mapping fields, not prose
